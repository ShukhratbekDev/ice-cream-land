# Testing Guide

> **Work in Progress**: This testing infrastructure is currently being planned and developed. The following documentation outlines our intended testing strategy and will be updated as components are implemented.

## Planned Testing Strategy

Ice Cream Land will follow a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. Our planned testing stack includes:

- **Jest** - Unit and Integration Testing
- **React Testing Library** - Component Testing
- **Cypress** - E2E Testing
- **MSW** - API Mocking
- **Vitest** - Unit Testing Runner

## Future Test Structure

```

├── unit/               # Unit tests (planned)
├── integration/        # Integration tests (planned)
├── e2e/               # End-to-end tests (planned)
└── __mocks__/         # Mock files (planned)
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Setup Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Install testing dependencies
- [ ] Configure Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] Set up Cypress for E2E testing
- [ ] Configure MSW for API mocking
- [ ] Set up test database configuration

### Phase 2: Unit Tests

- [ ] Component tests
- [ ] Hook tests
- [ ] Utility function tests
- [ ] API route tests

### Phase 3: Integration Tests

- [ ] API integration tests
- [ ] Database integration tests
- [ ] Authentication flow tests
- [ ] Cart functionality tests

### Phase 4: E2E Tests

- [ ] User journey tests
- [ ] Checkout process tests
- [ ] Authentication flow tests
- [ ] Multi-region functionality tests

## Future Test Coverage Goals

We aim to achieve the following coverage metrics:

- Unit Tests: > 80% coverage
- Integration Tests: > 70% coverage
- E2E Tests: All critical user flows

## Best Practices (To Be Implemented)

1. **Test Organization**

   - One test file per component/module
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Proper test isolation

2. **Testing Principles**
   - Test behavior, not implementation
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Use meaningful assertions

## Stay Tuned

This documentation will be updated as we implement each phase of our testing strategy. For updates on the testing implementation progress, please check:

1. GitHub Issues labeled with 'testing'
2. Project milestones
3. Release notes
